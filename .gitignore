# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm

# PyCharm
#   JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#   be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#   and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#   option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.

# Visual Studio Code
#   Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore 
#   that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#   and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer, 
#   you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
